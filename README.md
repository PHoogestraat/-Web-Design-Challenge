* A landing-page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization-pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* Comparisons-page:
  * Contains visualizations one page.
* A #data-page:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
    * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.

The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots navigation-menu.
